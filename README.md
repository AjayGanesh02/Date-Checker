# Date-Checker
A program that checks when my birthday (May 12) falls on the same day as mother's day (second sunday of may) in this century

My uncle challenged me to make a program that returns all the dates that my birthday lands on mother's day in this century. This is done using loops, conditionals, and the Calendar class (java.util.Calendar).
